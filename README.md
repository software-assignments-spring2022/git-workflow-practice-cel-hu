I clicked on this article because I have always been interested in learning more about artificial intelligence and its development in the tech field. As someone who is potentially looking at a career in software development, I was a little worried by this article when reading through it, as it seemed as though, to answer the question posed in the title of the article, yes, AI will bid goodbye to developers. Many companies are currently using AI technologies to try and beat out their competitors and with the speed at which technology is evolving, it seems as if the obvious answer is a heavier reliance on AI, which means fewer developers are needed. However, reaching the end of the article allowed me to breathe a sigh a relief, as AI is not quite yet developed enough to take over what software developers do now, and will not be for quite some time. As of now, AI is more of a tool that developers can utilize in order to optimize their own work. Companies look for developers who know how to best utilize AI to produce better software, and so more developers are definitely needed.
